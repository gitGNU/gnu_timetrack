Copy ttrack and tstats to a directory which is in the $PATH
( "${HOME}/bin/" is usually a good place, /usr/local/bin will work if you have
sufficient permissions to install there )

IFF you have been using timetrack before 2011-06-04, you should also copy
tconv10to11 and execute it in every directory containing a timetrack file.

Optionally create the file "${HOME}/.timetrack.rc"

Optionally create the directory "${HOME}/.timetrack.d/" and copy the file
"cost.sh" found in the "example-addon/" directory here.

timestats will ignore any and all scripts in the .timetrack.d directory that
aren't executable, so to activate or deactivate a certain add-on, toggle it's
executable flag.

Optionally create a separate ".timetrack.rc" file in every project directory
where you wish to change the configuration on a per project basis.

See README for configuration options and add-on functionality
